<h2>Creating a Print Stylesheet</h2>
<div class="contblock">

<p>When linking to your CSS, using <code>media="print"</code> will allow printer friendly styles to be applied.<br /><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="print_styles.css" media="print" /></code></p>
<p>To ensure your default styles wont also be applied to the printer, add <code>media="screen"</code> to the default styles link tag.</p>

<p>The key to a stylesheet specifically for printing is a matter of <em>planning</em> more than anything.</p>

<p>You'll need a few things prepared before you can begin:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A layout that is separated by divs in order to select specific areas for printing or not</li>
	<li>Semantic markup that supports page headlines</li>
	<li>Knowing what areas you want printed and what you don't</li>
	<li>Organize content so that printable areas are not nested in non-printable ones</li>
	<li>A recognition of why users will print pages - different styles based on different uses</li>
</ul>

<p>How to build your page. Make sure you have separate div elements for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>each content section you want printed</li>
	<li>page elements that represent titles or headers</li>
	<li>other printable elements (footers)</li>
	<li>non-printing elements (navigation/sidebars/header images/backgrounds)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have planned your layout and created distinct elements, the next steps are to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Hide the elements you don't want the printer to see</li>
	<li>Re-style the layout</li>
	<li>Re-style the visuals </li>
	<li>Add hyperlink data to Anchor elements</li>
</ol>

<h3>Hiding Elements</h3>
<p>Hide the DIV elements you don't want printed</p>
<pre><code>#header, #nav, #side  {
    display: none;
}</code></pre>
<p>This will tell the printer to ignore any of the elements listed in the declaration.  Be careful to make sure that none of the elements that are ignored have valuable info in them.</p>

<h3>Re-styling Layout</h3>
<p>You now have a number of <code>divs</code> remaining that will either have no style at all, or will inherit the styles of any sheets with "ALL" as the media.  For this reason, it is important to explicitly style the remaining <code>divs</code></p>
<pre><code>body, #content, #main, #footer  {
   float: none;
   width: auto;
   margin: 0;
   padding: 0;
   background: none;
}</code></pre>

<ul>
	<li>The <code>float</code> property is very important, as it can lead to major printing problems if you have any <code>divs</code> that have been floated</li>
	<li>The rest of the declarations will remove any width or padding restrictions, allowing the printer to set the margins for each page</li>
	<li>If you are using this sheet with another stylesheet that has ALL listed as the value for <code>media</code>, you might want to add <code>!important</code> after each rule, to be sure that there will be no inheritance problems</li>
	<li>Having a rule like <code>background: none;</code> is good if you use backgrounds, or if you don't.  If you do, they're gone, if you don't - consider it future-proofing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Re-styling Visuals</h3>
<p>This part is the most subjective.  You may want to have users continue to see the fonts and headings the way you displayed them on the screen, or you may want them to be of a more readable style.</p>

<p>Also, pay attention to colors here.  If you have a light-colored font on a dark-colored background on the screen, or if your anchors are lighter than normal, be sure to set them to a color that is easily seen after printing.</p>

<pre><code>body, #content, , #main, #footer {
	color: black;
	font: 12pt/15pt Georgia, "Times New Roman", Serif;
}
	
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
    font-family: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, Sans-serif;
}</code></pre>

<p>With the proliferation of color printers, you might want to choose a color that will show links in B&amp;W as well as color printing (I selected #309 - a compacted hex code for a medium-dark blue):</p>
<pre><code>
a:link, a:visited {
	color: #309;
	font-weight: bold;
	text-decoration: underline;
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Hyperlinks in Print</h3>
<p>One of the most useful things you can do in print format is to provide links for the user to see.  Without this little trick, they will only see a tags as they are displayed onscreen - likely a different colour and underlined.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> This only works in browsers that are fully CSS2 compliant.</p>

<p>Fully qualified (entire URL) links will be styled like this:</p>
<pre><code>a:link:after, 
a:visited:after{
   content: " (URL: " attr(href) ") ";
   font-size: 90%;
}</code></pre>

<p>This will append a URL to the end of a link on a page, surrounded in brackets with the acronym <code>URL:</code>.  The declaration starts with the <code>content</code> property and the value combined with the <code>attr(href)</code> value to the right of the colon.</p>

<h2>Media Queries</h2>
<div class="contblock">

<p>Media Queries have become very popular lately with the rise of mobile browsing on both phones, tablets and other devices. You can find a considerable amount of information at the W3C&apos;s site for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">CSS Media Queries</a>. The advanced media queries discussed here are largely CSS3, so consulting the <a href="http://caniuse.com/css-mediaqueries">Media Queries Browser Support Chart</a> can help you decide if your user's browser will be able to take advantage.</p>

<p>The ability to target specific device widths and orientations has made it possible to create &quot;Responsive&quot; web designs. <a href="http://ethanmarcotte.com/">Ethan Marcotte</a> wrote one of the very first articles on <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">Responsive Web Design</a> in 2010, and the idea has taken off since then. </p>

<p>Media Queries are just one part of Responsive Web Design, but they are a very important part. The concept is fairly simple: Use @media declarations to target device size and/or orientation using CSS</p>

<p>Because you have already created print stylesheets, you've used the concept! It's fundamentally the same idea, but instead of targeting a specific type of media, you will be targeting a specific size.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Basic Media Query</strong>: <br /><code>@media TYPE{ CSS rules go here }<br />@media screen{ screen CSS rules go here }<br />@media print{ printer CSS rules go here }</code></li>
	<li><strong>Compound Media Query</strong> Using the <code>and</code> conjunctive, you can chain together a series of conditional statements:<br /> <code>@media TYPE and (FEATURE: VALUE) { CSS rules go here }<br />@media screen and (min-width: 1024px){ CSS rules }<br />@media screen and (min-width: 800px) and (max-width: 1024px){ CSS rules }</code></li>
	<li><strong>Type</strong>: Target media type, mostly <strong>screen</strong>. If you want older browsers to avoid using your responsive styles, you use <strong>only screen</strong>, eg <br /><code>@media only screen and (min-width: 1024px){ CSS rules }</code></li>
	<li><strong>Feature</strong>: There are a number of features that can be targeted, including: 
		<ul>
			<li><strong>width</strong>: width of the viewport</li>
			<li><strong>height</strong>: height of the viewport</li>
			<li><strong>device-width</strong>: width of the device</li>
			<li><strong>device-height</strong>: height of the device</li>
			<li><strong>orientation</strong>: landscape or portrait</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	<li><strong>Value</strong>: the corresponding value such as size in pixels or other specifications like landscape</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Media queries can be specified in the <code>link</code> tag itself, like this:
</p>
<blockquote><code>
	&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="smaller.css" media="screen and (max-width: 1024px)" /&gt;
<br />	&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="larger.css" media="screen and (min-width: 1024px)" /&gt;
</code></blockquote>
<p>Media queries can be defined in the external CSS file, and linked to like any other stylesheet.</p>
<pre><code>@media only screen and (min-width: 1024px){ 
	/* define css rules */
	body { 
		background: lightgreen;
	}
}</code></pre>
<p>
	Additionally, some devices have been designed to display higher resolution pages in a smaller area.  This can cause confusion, and so a META tag was designed to get around this issue: 
</p>
<blockquote><code>
	&lt;meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width" /&gt;
</code></blockquote>

<h3>How do they work?</h3>
<p>When the page is initially rendered, the user agent (browser) will assess the size of the viewport and select CSS based on any media query declarations. This is also true if the viewport is resized.</p>

<h2>Example and Exercise</h2>
<div class="contblock">
<ul>
	<li><a href="/comp1950/downloads/media_query_example.zip">Download a media query example</a> and unzip the contents</li>
	<li>Examine the CSS, and test the HTML in a varying sized browser</li>
	<li>Add 2 new media queries after the ones already declared. Use them to determine the <code>min-height</code>/<code>max-height</code> of the viewport and hide (with <code>display:none;</code>) one of the two spans <code>#tall</code> or <code>#short</code></li>
	<li>Copy the first media query rule (the one that applies to small screens) and paste it at the end of all the media queries, so that it is the last of the media queries. How does this change the browser behavior? What kind of compound media query could fix this?</li>

<h2>Responsive Design</h2>
<div class="contblock">

	<p>Using media queries to deliver client specific styles opens up serveral possibilities for the web developer. Some guidelines for taking advantage of the abilities and limitations of client devices:</p>
<ul>
	<li>For small devices, design a one column layout</li>
	<li>Stack information in order of importance to the user. Start with an optional header, then a vertical navigation, followed by critical content, ordered by importance. In small devices there often isn't enough space to place all crucial content 'above the fold', so don't feel compelled to try</li>
	<li>Due to the dramatically different capabilities of clients, responsive web design is most effective with <strong>content driven</strong> sites as opposed to <strong>feature driven</strong> sites</li>
	<li>Dont try to design for specific devices: there are too many, and new different sized devices are appearing all the time. Fluid layouts will adapt more effectively to various device widths.</li>

<li>Apply media queries at the breakpoints whererever you can see your layout does not display optimally</li>


</ul>
</div>


<h2>Fixed vs Fluid</h2>
<div class="contblock">
<p>When looking at responsive designs, you must make the decision to build Fixed or Fluid layouts.</p>
<p>Fixed are easier to control as you know the widths and don't have to worry about overflowing elements, items that don't fit from side to side, margin and padding calculations and more.</p>
<p>Fluid designs use percentage and em (relative) widths for things that allow you to build a style that will scale to ANY size of user agent</p>



<p>The Flexible Grid is the key to being successful for fluid designs. There are two primary drivers behind this method:</p>
<ol>
	<li>target / context = result</li>
	<li>max-width: 100%</li>
</ol>

<p>The first calculation relates to your measurements for widths, margins, padding and even font-size when building a fluid design.</p>
<h3>Font Sizes</h3>

<p>For responsive, easy to maintain font sizing, assign a fixed pixel <code>font-size</code> to the <code>body</code>. Then style headings paragraphs etc using  the relative size <code>em</code>.</p>
<p>If you assume that you have set your body {...} element as having a font-size of 16px, then we have the two required parts of our calculation:</p>
<p>target (20) / context (16) = 1.25</p>

<p>Take that 1.25 as a relative measurement based on the default 16px setting. Use it now as the following:</p>
<pre><code>body{
	font-family: Arial, "Helvetica Neue", Sans-serif;
	font-size: 16px;
}
  
/* target / context = result */
/* 20     / 16      = 1.25   */
h1{
	/* This will render the font-size to the equivalent of 20px */
	font-size: 1.25em; 
}</code></pre>


<h3>Image widths</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges to any responsive design is images</p>
<p>Most images want to display at full size, but this method means they may be displayed at multiple sizes, and issuing width="..." and height="..." attributes in your IMG tags makes it difficult to make this work.</p>
<p>In comes the <strong>max-width</strong> rule in your CSS</p>
<p>Using this rule, you are essentially saying that the image should always be 100% of the parent element</p>
<p>With either a fixed or fluid layout, you will have your images respect the parent element's width, so you don't have to add width attributes in your &lt;img&gt; tags.</p>
<pre><code>img{
	max-width: 100%;
}</code></pre>
</div>
<h2>Fluid Fonts and Images Example</h2>
<div class="contblock">
	<ul>
		<li><a href="/comp1950/downloads/responsive_sizing.zip">Download a responsive font and image example</a> and unzip the contents</li>
		<li>Examine the HTML and CSS source code and test the HTML page in a varying sized web browser</li>
		<li>Try changing the <code>font-size</code> property assigned near the top of the CSS file. Note how changing one value can affect all textual content</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<h2>Grid Systems</h2>
<div class="contblock">
<p>Grid systems have been around for some time, trying to assist in the development of layouts</p>
<p>An early good one was <a href="http://960.gs">960.gs</a>, which allowed you to specify the number of columns wide you wanted any particular row to be</a>
<p>Initially focused on Fixed, it moved to including a Fluid layout as well</p>
<p>Since then, a huge number of grid systems have been introduced that make it a lot easier to build layouts.</p>
<p>Some popular ones:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.columnal.com/">Columnal</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/">Suzy</a></li>
</ul>

<p>However! I think it's very important that you start from scratch at some point, so you understand the limitations and how to adapt a pre-configured layout</p>
